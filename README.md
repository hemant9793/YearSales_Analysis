# YearSales_Analysis
In this project we are gonna be analysing the sales data of a store based in usa .
We will use Python and pandas first to do some basic data cleaning and after that we will merge the data to make a single dataframe out of it .
than with the help of matplotlib we will plot bar charts and various other charts which will help us in answering our questions.

questions we answered in this project were-
1. which is the best month in which most sales happened?
2.what is the best time to advertise so that likelyhood of purchase increases?
3.which product sold the most?
